Enables rich text editing on the excerpt field.

== Description ==

This is a simple plugin that enables rich text editing on the excerpt field. Tested in Wordpress 2.2.3 on PHP5, but probably works in 2.2.x, and maybe even 2.x… your mileage may vary. Any bugs? Let me know.

If you have any plugins installed which alter TinyMCE, e.g. to add additional buttons, they will also be applied to the excerpt editor.

=Known issues:=

* You can’t send images to the excerpt editor from the edit page file browser; you just have to send them to the main editor, then copy and paste.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `tinymce_excerpt.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Edit a post and enjoy the new rich styles in your excerpts

== Screenshots ==

1. Showing the TinyMCE Editor on the optional excerpt field, ready for editing.
