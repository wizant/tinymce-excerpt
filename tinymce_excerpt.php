Plugin Name: TinyMCE Excerpt
Plugin URI: http://www.simonwheatley.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/tinymce-excerpt/
Description: Use Tiny MCE for the excerpt while editing the excerpt.
Version: 1.31
Author: Simon Wheatley
Author URI: http://www.simonwheatley.co.uk/

= v1.31 2008/04/08 =

* Fix: Fixed some issues whereby some JS was being called on pages other than the post edit page. Refactored some code, no additional functionality.

= v1.3 2008/04/08 =

* Fix: Now works with WordPress 2.5. Thanks to [J Bradford Dillon](http://www.jbradforddillon.com/web-development/tinymce-excerpt-for-25/) 
for reporting the issue & providing some code. Retains backwards compatibility for previous versions of WordPress.

= v1.2 2007/11/23 =

* Fix: Thanks to [Jascha Ephraim](http://www.jaschaephraim.com/) for spotting 
and providing code to fix an issue where the excerpt content wasn't 
auto-paragraphised. It is now.

v1.1 - Safer use of jQuery, through the jQuery var itself. There's an awful lot of 
scripting going on in the edit pages.
